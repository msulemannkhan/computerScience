### Introduction To Computer Science

#### What is Computer Science?

The science that deals with the theory and methods of processing information in digital computers, the design of computer hardware and software, and the applications of computers.

#### What is Computer?

A computer is a device that can be instructed to carry out sequences of arithmetic or logical operations automatically via computer programming. Modern computers have the ability to follow generalized sets of operations, called programs.


#### What is Abacus?

An abacus is a very old tool used for math. It is still used in some parts of the world. Sometimes blind people will use an abacus, because they can feel the numbers easily. The most common abacuses work by moving beads on rods. Abacuses can do addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, and people can use them to find the square root of whole numbers. 

#### High Level - How Does a Computer Work?
* The computer follows a series of "code" instructions.
* Each instruction is simple (e.g. add 2 numbers).
* The computer "runs" a long series of instructions.
* Purely mechanical.

#### Fundamental Equation of Computers
Computer = Powerful + Stupid

#### CPU - Machine Code
"Software" is the general category of code which runs on the hardware. The common case is a "program" like Firefox -- software you run on your computer to solve a particular problem. A computer can run multiple programs at the same time and is responsible for keeping their memory separate.

A CPU understands a low level "machine code" language (also known as "native code"). The language of the machine code is hardwired into the design of the CPU hardware; it is not something that can be changed at will. Each family of compatible CPUs (e.g. the very popular Intel x86 family) has its own, idiosyncratic machine code which is not compatible with the machine code of other CPU families.

#### What is a Program/App?
The machine code defines a set of individual instructions. Each machine code instruction is extremely primitive, such as adding two numbers or testing if a number is equal to zero. When stored, each instruction takes up just a few bytes. When we said earlier that a CPU can execute 2 billion operations per second, we meant that the CPU can execute 2 billion lines of machine code per second.

A program, such as Firefox, is made up of a sequence of millions of these very simple machine code instructions. It's a little hard to believe that something as rich and complicated as Firefox can be built up out of instructions that just add or compare two numbers, but that is how it works. A sand sculpture can be rich and complicated when viewed from a distance, even though the individual grains of sand are extremely simple.
